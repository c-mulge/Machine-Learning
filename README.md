# Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** repository! This is my personal space dedicated to learning and mastering machine learning concepts, algorithms, and real-world applications. Every day, I document and upload the content I'm learning, including code samples, notebooks, explanations, and insights from various resources.

## Repository Purpose

- Track my progress as I learn new ML topics daily.
- Share practical implementations and tutorials.
- Organize useful resources, notes, and project ideas.
- Serve as a reference for personal revision and for other learners.

## Organization

- **Daily Uploads:** Each day's material is stored in its own dated folder or notebook.
- **Topics Covered:** Core ML concepts, Python code examples, exploratory data analysis, regression, classification, clustering, neural networks, and more.
- **Notes & Explanations:** Markdown files summarizing key points, intuitive explanations, and tips.
- **Projects:** Mini-projects and experiment files showcasing practical usage.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders by date or topic to access daily notes and code.
- Fork or clone this repo to practice and build your own learning library.
- Open Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for interactive code exploration.
- Suggest improvements or corrections via issues or pull requests.
